/* Lesson 1: Introduction to Modern JavaScript */

/* JavaScript is a general purpose programming language that is used to create interactive websites. It is a high-level, interpreted language that is easy to learn and use. JavaScript is a client-side language, meaning that it runs on the user's computer, rather than on the server. This allows JavaScript to interact with the user's browser and create dynamic, interactive web pages. */
